      <p><strong>Hello! I'm Bryan—</strong>and I love building things for the web. I started my journey as a developer in 2021, 
        before completing Caltech CTME’s postgraduate program in Full Stack Web Development. Since then, I've been
        completely hooked on the world of development. Over the past few years, I have cultivated my knowledge with 
        certifications, studying documentation, and building projects for personal growth.
        <br/><br/>
        I am excited about creating innovative and user-friendly applications and am ready to continue learning and 
        growing in the world of web dev. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my work and 
        learning more about my background and qualifications.</p>
