              <p><strong>Hi, my name is Bryan.</strong>I'm an artist and full stack web developer based near Worcester, MA.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I started in web development in 2021â€”before I was a student in Caltech CTME's full stack web dev postgrad program. 
                    I spent 9 months learning the fundamentals of front-end and back-end technologies and frameworks.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Right now, I'm taking night classes to further my front-end skills, and working on full stack projects that might 
                    have use some day.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Prior to web development, I wore many hats. I have experience in marketing for live events, sales, and even real estate.
                    <br/><br/>
