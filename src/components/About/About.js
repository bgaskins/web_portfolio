            <strong>Hello, I'm Bryan.</strong> I'm an artist and full stack web
            developer based near Worcester, MA. I started in web development in
            early 2022â€”before graduating from Caltech CTME's full stack web dev
            postgrad program.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now I build responsive and dynamic web applications from backend to
            front end.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've worked with Java/Spring/SQL, HTML/CSS/JS/TS, AWS, Angular,
            Next.js, React, and more.
            <br />
            <br />
            Prior to web development, I wore many hats. I have experience in
            marketing for live events, sales, and even real estate.
