              <p><strong>Hi, my name is Bryan.</strong> I'm an artist and full stack web developer based near Worcester, MA. </p>
            
                    <p>I started in web development in 2021â€”before I was a student in Caltech CTME's full stack web dev postgrad program. 
                    I spent 9 months learning the fundamentals of front-end and back-end technologies and frameworks.</p>

                    <p>Right now, I'm taking night classes to further my front-end skills, and working on full stack projects that might 
                    have use some day.</p>

                    <p>Prior to web development, I wore many hats. I have experience in marketing for live events, sales, and even real estate. </p>
